# roamresearch-themes
 collection of my themes for roam research website. The one here is modified from the Roam Research Dark Theme.  I'll add more if I ever decide to change it.

 see [Roam Research Themes](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/fJRcVITNY) for instructions.

 [Roam Research website](https://roamresearch.com/) is a great tool to organize reseach and notetaking.  It comes from org-mode on [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), which is also an awesome editor for writing and research, and a billion other things.

 Although it is not necessary, The easiest way I have found to switch and edit the theme colors for that website and others is using the [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) extension for chrome, available here: [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)
